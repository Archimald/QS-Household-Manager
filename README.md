# QuadSquad Household-Manager
The QuadSquad Household Manager is an Android application designed to simplify interactions between room-mates in a house. 
After logging in with your Google account, create a household and invite your room-mates to use the app as well.
Once you are in a group together, you can post to a unfied corkboard, as well as list chores that need to be done, and check to see whether each housemate is home or away

## How It Works
Once users log in, they are verified with an offsite Firebase database that stores the groups and keeps data synchronized accross all users.
Invites are sent via email address, so that when a user logs in with their Google account, their invites are sitting there waiting for them.
NFC tag scanning enables a quick toggle of Home or Away, triggered by a quick scan of an NFC tab near your front door.
